**Much of the world’s natural** beauty and animal species rest in places none of us will ever visit. So why not let one of the world’s highest-quality photo contests bring them to your virtual doorstep?

For a decade now, Wiki Loves Earth has been snapshotting the best of the globe’s natural heritage, whether it’s in a nationally protected area or in a nearby park. This year’s edition is no different: you are about to witness jaw-dropping animal close-ups juxtaposed with wide vistas of secluded solitude. The photos are a demonstration of human perseverance, dedication, and skill.

The contest winner (at top) finds a common tiger beetle perched upon an acorn, its objective unknown, in a wooded area located a bit east of Ukraine’s capital city, Kyiv. Wiki Loves Earth’s contest judges commended photographer Serhii Miroshnyk for the technical skills required to capture the moment. One judge compared it to the award-winning 1996 documentary Microcosmos, known for its close portrayal of insect interactions.
