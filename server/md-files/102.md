I used to call it the “month of mourning” … mostly because I grew up a comic book nerd, and I love alliteration.

You see, my mother died of cancer in June 2006, one month and one day before her 65th birthday. To say that kind of a loss leaves a mark isn’t necessary. Many of us have lost parents: Biological. Adopted. Foster. Family friends. Stand-ins, you know? “Uncle” Marvin. “Aunt” Eleanor. Whomever we looked up to, whoever we loved, we’ve lost them. And when I lost mine, I can say I lost the one person who loved me unconditionally. I lost someone I could never get back, a feeling of security and strength, and, of course, love that I would never get back.

So back in the day, when that particular month and a day rolled around, I went out. And then I went out some more. And some more. And some more. Clubs. Bars. House parties. I’d flood myself with liquor, anything to dull the pain of remembering that she was gone.
